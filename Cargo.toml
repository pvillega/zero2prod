# We could use any path here, but we are following the community convention
# We could specify a library name using the `name` field. If unspecified,
# cargo will default to `package.name`, which is what we want.

# Notice the double square brackets: it's an array in TOML's syntax.
# We can only have one library in a project, but we can have multiple binaries!
# If you want to manage multiple libraries in the same repository
# have a look at the workspace feature - we'll cover it later on.
